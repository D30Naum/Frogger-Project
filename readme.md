### Description

This project aimed to build the classic game of "Frogger" using the tkinter module and the pygame module. This game was 
created in 1981 by Konami and became a very famous game, especially in Japan. 

This specific game version consists of a frog 
trying to cross the street to the other side while avoiding cars and crocodiles.
There are three levels: Easy, Medium and Hard. Once you finish one, you go to the next one. If you would like to exit,
you can use the escape button. To restart, you can use the R button.

### Instructions to operate the game

- Make sure you have downloaded the latest Python version (write "pip3 install --upgrade pip" in the terminal)
- Download the Pygame module by opening the terminal and inputting "pip3 install pygame"
- Download the "Game Project" folder
- Navigate to the "Intro_page" Python file
- Run the file and enjoy playing the game :)
